// SECURITY VALIDATION REPORT
// ===========================

/*
CRITICAL VULNERABILITIES FIXED:
✓ Authorization Bypass - Now uses session userId instead of request body
✓ Race Conditions - Implemented atomic limit checking with transactions  
✓ Ownership Verification - All scan endpoints verify user ownership
✓ Missing Authentication - Added requireAuth middleware to all sensitive endpoints
✓ Rate Limiting - Added comprehensive rate limiting for different endpoint types
✓ Audit Logging - Subscription changes now logged with timestamps and user info
✓ Scraping Timeouts - Added timeout protection for expensive scraping operations
✓ Session Security - Secure session configuration with httpOnly, sameSite, etc.

SECURITY MEASURES IMPLEMENTED:

1. Authentication & Authorization:
   - requireAuth middleware on all sensitive endpoints
   - Session-based user identification (not request body)
   - Ownership verification for all user data access

2. Rate Limiting:
   - Scan creation: 5 requests/minute per IP
   - General API: 100 requests/minute per IP  
   - Subscription changes: 3 changes/5 minutes per IP

3. Cost Protection:
   - Monthly scan limits enforced atomically
   - Scraping operation timeouts (30-45 seconds)
   - Request size limiting (1MB max)
   - Lifetime plan abuse prevention

4. Audit & Monitoring:
   - Subscription change logging
   - Suspicious activity detection
   - Plan switching abuse detection
   - Security event logging

5. Input Validation:
   - Zod schema validation on all endpoints
   - Request size validation
   - Timeout protection on long-running operations

REMAINING RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Add HTTPS enforcement in production
- Implement session rotation on privilege escalation
- Add CSRF tokens for state-changing operations
- Monitor logs for suspicious patterns
- Set up alerts for rapid plan switching
- Consider adding IP-based blocking for abuse

COST PROTECTION STATUS: ✓ SECURE
Your subscription system is now protected against:
- Unlimited free usage abuse
- Race condition exploits  
- Cross-user data access
- Plan manipulation attacks
- Scraping operation abuse
