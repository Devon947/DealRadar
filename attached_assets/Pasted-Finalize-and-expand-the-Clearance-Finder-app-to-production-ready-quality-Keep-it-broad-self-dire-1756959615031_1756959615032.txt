Finalize and expand the “Clearance Finder” app to production-ready quality. Keep it broad, self-directed, and based on my screenshots’ style (soft blue gradient, rounded cards, pill CTAs, subtle shadows, stepper, stat blocks). Use the existing stack; if none, scaffold a modern SPA (React + Router + Tailwind). Maintain mock data where needed.  

========================
CORE REQUIREMENTS
========================
• THEME: Unified bluish brand tone from homepage header. Remove all orange.  
• NAVIGATION: Single Home tab only. Fixed/sticky top nav with offset.  
• ZIP: Required onboarding; immutable once set; read-only in Settings with support note + lock icon. Guard all routes until ZIP is set.  
• RETAILERS: Active = Home Depot, Lowe’s, Ace, Amazon. Walmart blurred “Coming Soon.” Wordmarks spelled out inside logo container.  
• LOCATION: Ask for geolocation permission only to rank store results by distance; never changes ZIP. Add distance chips + nearest/farthest toggle.  

========================
AUTH & ACCOUNTS
========================
• Auth shell with mock signup/login.  
• Require verified email to unlock referrals, affiliates, history, alerts.  
• Profile: Name, Email, Plan, ZIP (locked), Referral code.  
• Auth state persisted.  

========================
MEMBERSHIP & PRICING
========================
Plans (fair + enforced with usage meters):  
1) Starter — $25/mo — up to 10 stores scanned/month (Home Depot, Lowe’s, Ace, Amazon), standard speed, email support.  
2) Pro — $55/mo — up to 30 stores/month, priority speed, alerts + lists, email + chat support.  
3) Elite — $99/mo — up to 50 stores/month, early access to Walmart, analytics dashboard, priority support.  

Rules:  
• Free trial: 3 scans in 7 days.  
• Usage meters: show current use (e.g. “8/10 scans used”).  
• Upgrade CTAs if limits exceeded.  
• Refund/Usage Terms: show on Pricing and link in footer.  

========================
SCANNING & RESULTS
========================
/scan page (reworked): Stepper, sticky utility bar (Retailer chip, ZIP pill, Radius, Start Scan).  
Setup cards: choose locations (distance sorted), filters (categories, discount slider, price, stock toggle, online/in-store), options.  
Results: grid/list with discount badge, stock indicator, distance.  
Add “freshness badge” (“Updated 12m ago”).  
Cache last scan; show cached instantly + “refreshing…” skeleton.  

========================
HISTORY, LISTS, ALERTS
========================
History: one header only, list of past scans. Add Analytics dashboard (total scans, avg savings, top stores/categories).  
Lists: add “Sort” control (Most Recent, Discount, Price, Store A→Z), persist choice.  
Alerts: rules + Notification Center (bell icon).  

========================
REFERRALS & AFFILIATES
========================
Referral system: each profile has a code; support ?ref=CODE param attribution persisted.  
Settings > Referral: show referral link + QR + copy/share + mock stats.  
Affiliates tab: program overview, affiliate link + QR, UTM builder, mock payouts, resources.  

========================
HELP & SUPPORT
========================
Help page: FAQ, chat widget (plugin-ready), Email Support form (success + mailto fallback).  
Support workflow: Admin can view tickets, mark open/triaged/closed, use canned replies.  

========================
ADMIN (password = password123)
========================
• RBAC: roles = owner, support.  
• Owner: change ZIP (mock), set plan, view audit log.  
• Support: view tickets, triage.  
• Audit log (append-only): admin login, ZIP overrides, plan changes.  
• Metrics: scans today, active alerts, referrals, support tickets.  

========================
COMPLIANCE & LEGAL
========================
• Retailer brand usage disclaimer: “Not affiliated with Home Depot, Lowe’s, Ace, Amazon, or Walmart.” Display in footer.  
• Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, Cookie Notice pages.  
• Privacy must explain ZIP policy and geolocation usage.  
• Scraping/API policy page: clarify that only public data/APIs allowed; no ToS circumvention.  

========================
ACCESSIBILITY & PERFORMANCE
========================
• Accessibility sweep: tab order, focus rings, alt text on all logos, 4.5:1 contrast, reduced-motion respected.  
• Micro-interactions: buttons have gradient shift, hover lift, ripple on mobile, consistent focus ring.  
• Code splitting for heavy pages; skeletons for loads.  
• PWA: add manifest + service worker (offline shell for history/lists).  
• Add error + event tracking (mock Sentry + analytics events: scan_start, scan_complete, plan_blocked, upgrade_click).  

========================
ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
========================
• Unified blue brand applied everywhere.  
• Only one Home header; ZIP is required, locked, and clearly marked as unchangeable.  
• Location permission ranks stores only; ZIP never changes.  
• Pricing tiers enforced with meters; free trial works; Refund/Usage Terms visible.  
• Results show stock freshness + caching; History has analytics; Lists have Sort; Alerts integrate with Notification Center.  
• Referrals & affiliates work (links, QR, attribution, mock stats).  
• Help has chat + email support; Admin gated by password + RBAC roles; audit log captures actions.  
• Terms, Privacy, Cookie, and Scraping/API policy pages included.  
• Accessibility + performance standards met (PWA, error tracking, skeletons).  

========================
DELIVERABLE
========================
A production-ready, blue-themed app with all features above, using mock data and broad, extensible design. Ensure the app feels complete, membership rules are enforced, and all legal + compliance basics are in place.
