Rebuild and expand the “Clearance Finder” app into a full, cohesive product that matches the screenshots’ vibe (soft gradient blue theme, rounded cards, pill CTAs, icon badges, stepper, stat blocks). Use the existing stack; if none is detected, scaffold with a modern SPA (React + Router + Tailwind). Keep everything broad and self-directed, with mock data where needed.  

========================
GLOBAL RULES
========================
• THEME: Use the SAME bluish tone from the homepage header as the brand color. Replace all orange with this blue.  
• NAVIGATION: One single Home tab only. Fixed/sticky top nav with offset so content is never hidden.  
• ICONS: Each retailer (Home Depot, Lowe’s, Ace, Walmart, Amazon) must display the correct logo/icon.  
• ZIP REQUIRED: Onboarding forces ZIP entry before anything else. Save to “account profile,” make it immutable to users. Show ZIP as read-only in Settings. Only Admin can change.  
• ROUTE GUARD: Block all routes (scan, results, history, lists, alerts, pricing, settings, help) until ZIP is set.  
• HELP + SUPPORT: Add a chat widget placeholder (plugin-ready) and an Email Support form. Both visible on Help page and via footer.  

========================
HOME (/)  
========================
• Hero: Title, subtitle, CTA “Start Finding Deals.”  
• On clicking CTA → smooth scrolls down to the Retailer Grid.  
• Retailer Grid: 5 large tiles with correct icons/logos. User must select a store to move forward.  
• After selection, either reveal a “Continue” button or auto-route to /scan with retailer set.  
• Feature Cards, Stats Row, and Stepper preview below grid (same blue theme).  

========================
/SCAN (REWORK COMPLETELY)  
========================
Delete current scan content and rebuild consistent with the app.  
• Sticky stepper (Select → Configure → Scan → Results).  
• Utility bar: Retailer chip (logo + name), ZIP pill (read-only), Radius pill (editable), “Start Scan” button.  
• Main content (2-col desktop, stacked mobile):  
  LEFT: Setup Cards  
    1) Locations: selectable store list (mock, filtered by ZIP).  
    2) Filters: category chips, min discount slider, price range, in-stock toggle, online vs in-store toggles.  
    3) Options: result limit, default sort, show/hide out-of-stock preview.  
  RIGHT: Live Preview  
    • Summary chips (Retailer, ZIP, Radius, Stores selected, Filters count).  
    • Tiny mock preview grid.  
    • Secondary “Continue” button.  
• Start Scan → short skeleton → /results.  

========================
/RESULTS  
========================
• Grid/list of mock deal cards: product image, title, original vs clearance price, discount badge, store.  
• Actions: Save to List, Share, Favorite.  
• Toolbar: Sort (Discount, Price, Distance), Filter chips visible.  

========================
/HISTORY  
========================
• List of past scans with timestamp + summary.  
• Empty state: “No scans yet” + CTA.  
• Add an **Analytics Dashboard** section: total scans run, average savings %, top stores, top categories.  

========================
/LISTS  
========================
• Saved lists of items, with mock items.  
• Empty state: “No saved items yet.”  
• Features: Sort/filter, export to CSV, “Share list” button (mock share link).  
• Quick “Favorites” list auto-generated from starred items.  

========================
/ALERTS  
========================
• Alerts page with empty state + “Create Alert.”  
• Add in-app Notification Center (bell icon in nav).  
• Alerts can trigger: “Notify me when discount > X%,” “Alert me for [Category],” etc.  
• Alerts should demo in both page + Notification Center.  

========================
/PRICING  
========================
• Free vs Premium plan cards.  
• Free plan: limited stores/alerts. Premium plan: unlocks scanning up to 25 stores, unlimited alerts.  
• Premium features should appear throughout app as locked with “Upgrade” CTA (mock only).  

========================
/SETTINGS  
========================
• Account profile panel: name, email, subscription level (mock).  
• ZIP (read-only, immutable).

  – Toggle chat plugin state (mock).  
  – User list (mock).  
  – Metrics: total scans today, active alerts, support requests.  
  – Premium toggle for mock users.  

========================
STATE & PERSISTENCE  
========================
• Central store: { zip, radius, retailerId, filters, options, isAdmin, profile, notifications }.  
• Persist essentials (zip, radius, retailerId, profile).  
• ZIP required guard applies everywhere.  

========================
ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA  
========================
• Only one Home page in nav.  
• ZIP is required, immutable for users, and enforced globally.  
• “Start Finding Deals” CTA smooth-scrolls to Retailer Grid → store selection required.  
• Retailer logos correct.  
• /scan reworked to match app theme and flow.  
• Results, History (with Analytics), Lists (with Sharing), Alerts (with Notification Center), Pricing (with Upgrade CTAs), Settings, Help (with Chat + Email), Admin (with password123) all present and consistent.  
• All orange removed; unified blue brand tokens used everywhere.  
• Chat/email support ready to be connected.  
• Admin page functions as simple mock CMS.  

========================
DELIVERABLE  
========================
A cohesive, blue-themed, full app with all features above, using mock data and broad, extensible design. No backend needed, but all flows must feel real and production-ready.
